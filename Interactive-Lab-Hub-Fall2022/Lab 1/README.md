# Staging Interaction

In the original stage production of Peter Pan, Tinker Bell was represented by a darting light created by a small handheld mirror off-stage, reflecting a little circle of light from a powerful lamp. Tinkerbell communicates her presence through this light to the other characters. See more info [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinker_Bell). 

There is no actor that plays Tinkerbell--her existence in the play comes from the interactions that the other characters have with her.

For lab this week, we draw on this and other inspirations from theatre to stage interactions with a device where the main mode of display/output for the interactive device you are designing is lighting. You will plot the interaction with a storyboard, and use your computer and a smartphone to experiment with what the interactions will look and feel like. 

_Make sure you read all the instructions and understand the whole of the laboratory activity before starting!_



## Prep

### To start the semester, you will need:
1. Read about Git [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-What-is-Git%3F).
2. Set up your own Github "Lab Hub" repository to keep all you work in record by [following these instructions](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Developing-and-Designing-Interactive-Devices/blob/2021Fall/readings/Submitting%20Labs.md).
3. Set up the README.md for your Hub repository (for instance, so that it has your name and points to your own Lab 1) and [learn how to](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) organize and post links to your submissions on your README.md so we can find them easily.


### For this lab, you will need:
1. Paper
2. Markers/ Pens
3. Scissors
4. Smart Phone -- The main required feature is that the phone needs to have a browser and display a webpage.
5. Computer -- We will use your computer to host a webpage which also features controls.
6. Found objects and materials -- You will have to costume your phone so that it looks like some other devices. These materials can include doll clothes, a paper lantern, a bottle, human clothes, a pillow case, etc. Be creative!

### Deliverables for this lab are: 
1. 7 Storyboards
1. 3 Sketches/photos of costumed devices
1. Any reflections you have on the process
1. Video sketch of 3 prototyped interactions
1. Submit the items above in the lab1 folder of your class [Github page], either as links or uploaded files. Each group member should post their own copy of the work to their own Lab Hub, even if some of the work is the same from each person in the group.

### The Report
This README.md page in your own repository should be edited to include the work you have done (the deliverables mentioned above). Following the format below, you can delete everything but the headers and the sections between the **stars**. Write the answers to the questions under the starred sentences. Include any material that explains what you did in this lab hub folder, and link it in your README.md for the lab.

## Part A. Plan 

To stage an interaction with your interactive device, think about:

_Setting:_ Where is this interaction happening? (e.g., a jungle, the kitchen) When is it happening?

_Players:_ Who is involved in the interaction? Who else is there? If you reflect on the design of current day interactive devices like the Amazon Alexa, it’s clear they didn’t take into account people who had roommates, or the presence of children. Think through all the people who are in the setting.

_Activity:_ What is happening between the actors?

_Goals:_ What are the goals of each player? (e.g., jumping to a tree, opening the fridge). 

The interactive device can be anything *except* a computer, a tablet computer or a smart phone, but the main way it interacts needs to be using light.

\*\***Describe your setting, players, activity and goals here.** \*\*

 - The scenario I'm thinking about is monitoring workout movements. So you have the correct moves in database as they have trained models from computer vision technology. And whenever you look towards a screen or a mirror and stand in the correct spot, it will tell you whether you're doing the correct moves or not. And if the movement is correct, it will pass and probably show a green light; if not, it will show a red sign and maybe an alarm sound.  



Storyboards are a tool for visually exploring a users interaction with a device. They are a fast and cheap method to understand user flow, and iterate on a design before attempting to build on it. Take some time to read through this explanation of [storyboarding in UX design](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/10/storyboarding-ux-design/). Sketch seven storyboards of the interactions you are planning. **It does not need to be perfect**, but must get across the behavior of the interactive device and the other characters in the scene. 

\*\***Include pictures of your storyboards here**\*\*

Present your ideas to the other people in your breakout room (or in small groups). You can just get feedback from one another or you can work together on the other parts of the lab.

\*\***Summarize feedback you got here.**\*\*
 - they said it's a great idea for maybe self workout without trainers. 

## Part B. Act out the Interaction

Try physically acting out the interaction you planned. For now, you can just pretend the device is doing the things you’ve scripted for it. 

\*\***Are there things that seemed better on paper than acted out?**\*\*

 - I feel like on paper I don‘t need to think about angles and scales, but in reality with actual acting out the interaction, I need to get the right angle to make sure the screen monitor can track my movements. I made an interactive program with my partner back in undergrad with google teachable machine cv image models. And we need to adjust user position to fit the screen.

\*\***Are there new ideas that occur to you or your collaborators that come up from the acting?**\*\*

 - new ideas are like we can switch the image detect models to motion control models so that it can be more flexible and we might need a larger screen like a mirror instead of a laptop so that it can be more convenient for users to act the workout moves.

## Part C. Prototype the device

You will be using your smartphone as a stand-in for the device you are prototyping. You will use the browser of your smart phone to act as a “light” and use a remote control interface to remotely change the light on that device. 

Code for the "Tinkerbelle" tool, and instructions for setting up the server and your phone are [here](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/tinkerbelle).

We invented this tool for this lab! 

If you run into technical issues with this tool, you can also use a light switch, dimmer, etc. that you can can manually or remotely control.

\*\***Give us feedback on Tinkerbelle.**\*\*

 - tinkerbelle tool is really cool, but for myself the program couldn't run in the first place because my environment is in conda so I need to change some variables. And without help, it might be a bit difficult to set up the environment if others run into similar issues.

## Part D. Wizard the device
Take a little time to set up the wizarding set-up that allows for someone to remotely control the device while someone acts with it. Hint: You can use Zoom to record videos, and you can pin someone’s video feed if that is the scene which you want to record. 

\*\***Include your first attempts at recording the set-up video here.**\*\*

 - As I'm not sure how to set up my device and apparently I'm not using Tinkerbelle, I will describe my process of remote control. For example, a trainer can remotely set the order and number of poses on the device to acheive a certain training goal for the user. And after that, the trainer can look at the score of the user's performance after one workout and give feedback. 

Now, change the goal within the same setting, and update the interaction with the paper prototype. 


\*\***Show the follow-up work here.**\*\*

 - instead of randomly switching movements, there could be someone remotely control which pose they should do.

## Part E. Costume the device

Only now should you start worrying about what the device should look like. Develop three costumes so that you can use your phone as this device.

Think about the setting of the device: is the environment a place where the device could overheat? Is water a danger? Does it need to have bright colors in an emergency setting?

\*\***Include sketches of what your devices might look like here.**\*\*

![My Image](image/3.JPG)

\*\***What concerns or opportunitities are influencing the way you've designed the device to look?**\*\*

 - The concern is that for daylight mode, the light might not be that obvious for users to observe and follow, so might need to set up brighter color.

 - The opportunities can be exercise at home and if ever quarantine happens again, trainers can preload the training on the device and ask the users to finish it by themselves.

## Part F. Record

\*\***Take a video of your prototyped interaction.**\*\*

 - Here is the [video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FOjjraOnAWeBPohgGYckHrOkl93GUCFK/view?usp=sharing)

\*\***Please indicate anyone you collaborated with on this Lab.**\*\*
Be generous in acknowledging their contributions! And also recognizing any other influences (e.g. from YouTube, Github, Twitter) that informed your design. 

 - My undergrad partner Rebecca Wei!! We made the small program together.


# Staging Interaction, Part 2 

This describes the second week's work for this lab activity.


## Prep (to be done before Lab on Wednesday)

You will be assigned three partners from another group. Go to their github pages, view their videos, and provide them with reactions, suggestions & feedback: explain to them what you saw happening in their video. Guess the scene and the goals of the character. Ask them about anything that wasn’t clear. 

\*\***Summarize feedback from your partners here.**\*\*

My partners and peer reviews told me that my storyboards were not quite clear, thus I changed mine into five different scenarios. 

## Make it your own

Do last week’s assignment again, but this time: 
1) It doesn’t have to (just) use light, 
2) You can use any modality (e.g., vibration, sound) to prototype the behaviors! Again, be creative! Feel free to fork and modify the tinkerbell code! 
3) We will be grading with an emphasis on creativity. 

\*\***Document everything here. (Particularly, we would like to see the storyboard and video, although photos of the prototype are also great.)**\*\*
